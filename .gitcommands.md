# Git Command Instructions

## Current Issue
You have an unfinished merge, and your local and remote branches have diverged (they both have different commits).

## Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Complete the merge
If you want to keep the changes from both branches:

```bash
# First, check status to see what files are in conflict
git status

# Resolve any conflicts in your editor if needed
# Then add the resolved files
git add .

# Commit the merge
git commit -m "Completed merge"

# Push to origin
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Abort the merge and try again
If you want to start over with the merge:

```bash
# Abort the current merge
git merge --abort

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Force push your changes (use with caution)
Only if you're sure your local changes should overwrite remote changes:

```bash
git push -f origin main
```

## Note about command syntax
The correct syntax for pushing is:
```bash
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

In your case:
```bash
git push origin main
```

Not:
```bash
git push main origin  # This is incorrect
```

## Common Git commands reference

```bash
# Check status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-branch-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout branch-name

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin branch-name

# Stash changes
git stash

# Apply stashed changes
git stash apply

# Discard all local changes
git reset --hard HEAD

# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
